Understanding A Parser (Lab 6 Review)

## Description
In short, we want to create a deeper understanding of a short circuiting and how it works. In Lab 3 and 4, we've written short circuting into our interpreters, but here we want to break it down in order to understand its functionality. Short circuiting is a very usefull tool in doing very large computations because it can save uneccesary computation time and reasources. The basic Idea is that if you are doing a larger computation and after evaluating something in the computation you know the result, instead of wasting CPU cycles and time finishing the computation you just stop and return the result you already know.
